## What Dashly Is

**Dashly** is a lightweight, real-time dashboard for users of **Nginx Proxy Manager**. It simplifies how you monitor and organize your services by automatically syncing with your NPM database. This means you never have to manually edit dashboard configuration files like YAMLâ€”it dynamically tracks and displays all your services based on their domain configurations in NPM.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic Updates:**
  - **Dashly** reads from the **Nginx Proxy Manager database**, automatically updating your dashboard whenever you add, remove, or modify domains.
- **Interactive UI:**
  - Organize services with drag-and-drop groups.
  - Toggle between grid and list views.
  - Search and filter services for quick access.
- **Customizable Appearance:**
  - Multiple themes, including a light and dark mode.
  - Visibility toggles for inactive services.
- **Group Management:**
  - Categorize services into customizable groups.
  - Rename and sort groups for easier navigation.

## Why It's Useful

If you use **Nginx Proxy Manager**, you likely already have domain names set up for your services. **Dashly** takes that data and creates a clean, automatically updating dashboard. It eliminates the repetitive task of manually maintaining dashboard YAML files for tools like **Dashy** or **Homepage**. **Dashly** is tailored for **NPM** users who value automation and simplicity.

## Future Roadmap

- Add a "Favorites" group for quick access to preferred services.
- Enable hiding groups or individual services.
- Support for custom app icons and renaming services.
- Enhance drag-and-drop functionality for smoother interaction.
- Introduce collapsible groups for better organization.
- Toggle displayed information for a cleaner look.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Access to your Nginx Proxy Manager database.

### Deployment Steps

1. Create a new directory for Dashly and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir dashly
   cd dashly
   ```

2. Create the `.env` file with the required variables:

   ```bash
   echo "NGINX_DB_PATH=/path/to/your/nginx/database.sqlite" >> .env
   echo "USER_SETTINGS=/data/" >> .env
   ```

3. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lklynet/dashly/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

4. Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are using an older version of Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Access the dashboard at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Troubleshooting

If the app isn't running, has database errors, or doesn't show any services:

1. Double-Check:

   - `.env` variables are correct and point to your Nginx Proxy Manager `database.sqlite`.
   - User permissions are correct to read the database.
   - The directory is bind-mounted to the Docker host.

2. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   apt install python3 sqlite3
   pip3 install flask
   ```

   Then rebuild or update the container, and it should start right up.
